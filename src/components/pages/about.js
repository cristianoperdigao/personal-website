                    Hello! I'm Cristiano, a software engineer based in London, who enjoys building things that live on the internet. I develop exceptional websites and web apps that provide intuitive, pixel-perfect user interfaces with efficient and modern backends.
                    Shortly after studied from polytechnic institute of Set√∫bal, I joined the engineering team at Upstatement where I work on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.

            </div>
        );
    }
